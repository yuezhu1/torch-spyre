 * translates each step into flex operation params and submits them via its

 *

 * .to(device) or binary loading), a JobPlan with only DMA steps is used.

 * Producers:
 * - Backend compiler (deeptools) via torch-spyre: Deeptools produces a
 *   SpyreCode JSON per SDSC. torch-spyre translates the SpyreCode into a
 *   JobPlan — executing the Job Preparation Plan (allocations, binary loading)
 *   and translating the Job Execution Plan into JobPlanStep entries with
 *   resolved CompositeAddress values. A single torch.compile call may produce
 *   multiple SDSCs, resulting in multiple JobPlans.
 * - Communications libraries: Create JobPlans for inter-device data transfers,
 *   collective operations, or other multi-step communication patterns.
 * - torch-spyre: Assembles JobPlans for tensor .to(device) moves (single
 *   RuntimeOperationH2D step), tensor .to("cpu") readbacks (single
 *   RuntimeOperationD2H step), or any other sequence of operations it needs to
