    #      for the size-1 device dim, which causes compute_coordinates to emit a
    #      constant nonzero stick offset and normalize_coordinates to assert.

    #      takes an explicit dim_order whose last element names the within-stick
    #      host dim; we must carry this over from the original buffer so that the
