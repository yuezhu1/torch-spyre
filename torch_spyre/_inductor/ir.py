    """Derive a new SpyreTensorLayout for a resized host buffer.

    Used in two directions:

    * **shrink** (``_divide_ranges``): the buffer is the same physical
      allocation; coarse tiling narrows the per-tile iteration range.
      ``device_size`` entries for non-stick dims shrink to reflect the smaller
      per-tile extents.
    * **grow** (``_allocate_full_buffer``): a full-sized scatter-target buffer
      is allocated to match a per-tile source.  ``device_size`` entries grow
      back to the full extent.  The stick orientation (transposed vs row-major,
      ``element_arrangement``) is propagated verbatim so both buffers agree on
      physical layout and scatter-copy address arithmetic is correct.

    ``stride_map`` semantics: a value of ``-1`` means "this device dimension has
    extent 1 and is never stepped through; its stride is undefined."  When
    growing back from a singleton (``orig_sm[j] == -1``), the stride is
    recomputed from the new host stride (the rescue arm in Passes 2–4).  For
    non-contiguous (transposed / col-major) dims, the *physical* stride on
    device is invariant to resizing, so it is left unchanged.

    Device-dim classification (as produced by ``get_generic_stick_layout``):

    * **inner stick** (always ``j == ndev-1``) — ``device_size`` is always
      ``elems_per_stick``; left unchanged.  ``stride_map`` updated only if the
      stick host dim is contiguous or was a singleton.
    * **non-stick dim** — one device dim per non-stick host dim.  Matched to
      host dim ``p`` by size (``device_size[j] == old_host_size[p]``), with
      ``stride_map[j]`` used as a tiebreaker when two host dims share the same
      size.  ``device_size`` updated to ``new_host_size[p]``.  ``stride_map``
      updated iff ``orig_sm[j] == old_hs[p]`` (contiguous) or ``== -1``
      (was a singleton being grown).
    * **stick tile-count** — ``ceil(old_host_size[p*] / eps)`` device elements
      spanning the stick host dim ``p*``.  Updated to
      ``ceil(new_host_size[p*] / eps)``.  Same stride-update rule as non-stick.
    * **singleton** (``device_size == 1, stride_map == -1``) — either a sparse
      placeholder (no corresponding host dim) or a non-stick dim tiled to
      extent 1.  Left as-is when there is no host dim to match; matched by
      size-1 to a host dim of size 1 when one exists (grow path from singleton).

    ``p*`` (the stick host dim) is identified by elimination: the unique host
    dim *not* matched as a non-stick dim.  When a reduction collapses the stick
    axis, all host dims are matched as non-stick and ``pstar`` is ``None``; in
    that case Passes 3 and 4 are skipped (tile-count and inner-stick entries are
    frozen at their collapsed values).

    ``stick_host_dim`` (optional): the authoritative stick host-dim index,
    supplied by callers that know it from named-dim identity.  When given, it is
    used directly as ``p*`` and is excluded from the non-stick candidate pool,
    which resolves same-size-dim collisions (transposed layouts where two host
    dims share a size, e.g. flash-attention QK^T with ``Sq == Skv`` — issue
    #3116) without relying on the ambiguous size-elimination + contiguous-stride
    tiebreak.  When ``None`` (all current callers), behaviour is unchanged.

    Multi-pass algorithm:

    * **Pass 1**: match non-inner-stick device dims to host dims by size.
      Size-1 dims match only to host dims of size 1.  Size > 1 dims match by
      ``device_size == old_host_size[p]``, with stride as tiebreaker when sizes
      collide.  Unmatched dims are candidates for tile-count.
    * **Pass 1b**: fix tile-count / size collisions.  When
      ``ceil(old_host_size[p*] / eps) == old_host_size[q]`` for some non-stick
      dim ``q``, the tile-count dim and dim ``q`` have the same size and Pass 1
      may have provisionally claimed the tile-count dim as a non-stick dim.
      Pass 1b corrects this after ``p*`` is provisionally known: a provisional
      match is reclassified as tile-count when its stride also mismatches the
      expected contiguous non-stick stride.
    * **Pass 2**: update non-stick dims (``matched_host``).
    * **Pass 3**: validate and update tile-count dims (``unmatched_j``).
    * **Pass 4**: update inner stick (``j == ndev-1``).

    ``device_dtype`` and ``element_arrangement`` are copied verbatim from
    ``orig_stl``, preserving EXX2/QFP8/DL16 layouts.

    Raises ``RuntimeError`` if any non-stick device dim matches ambiguously, or
    if the stick host dim cannot be uniquely determined by elimination.
