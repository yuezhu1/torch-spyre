"""IR-level pass to pad y's K (row) dimension to a stick boundary for
BATCH_MATMUL_OP operations.  Runs in CustomPreSchedulingPasses immediately
after insert_restickify, when every ComputedBuffer has a FixedTiledLayout.

Only y is padded; x is left untouched.

For y, the following IR sequence is emitted:
  1. ComputedBuffer - output buffer allocation (FixedLayout)
  2. SpyreConstantFallback - fill constant (FixedLayout)
  3. ComputedBuffer - fill padding region (MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE)
  4. ComputedBuffer - copy input data (MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE)

y's padded buffer is built at the full K_padded host size by lower_pad_sequence.
reduction_ranges stays at K; the K→K_padded extension happens at SDSC codegen
time: _extend_matmul_k_to_padded in superdsc.py reads K_padded from y's
device_size and widens sdsc_iteration_space[K] to K_padded before
_create_sdsc_tensors runs.

x is left physically untouched.  The hardware masks within-stick elements of x
beyond the true K to zero, so extending the SDSC iteration to K_padded does not
introduce numerical error from x.

Deduplication of identical constants across multiple pad calls happens later
at the IR level via dedup_and_promote_constants.

x and y are identified via identify_matmul_inputs() using the BatchMatmul
generated_dim definition: y is the input whose index contains a symbol
present in the output but absent from x (N).  This handles M==K==N and
M=1 (decode phase) correctly.

    A restickify re-tiles a tensor so a different host dim lands within the
    stick.  Codegen widens both its read and its write to stick boundaries, so
    both buffers need dims that cover the widened access.  The write side and the
    read side are independent -- either can need padding without the other -- so
    this pass handles them separately:

    - Write side (``_pad_restickify_output``): keeps the output's old-stick host
      dim at the correct physical offset.
    - Read side (``_pad_restickify_input``): keeps the read within the allocation.

    Padding touches only the device layout, never host tensor dim sizes, so later
    passes that depend on host sizes (e.g. ``propagate_named_dims``) see the
    tensor unchanged.  Codegen's backGap path covers the resulting host/device
    gap.

    A size-1 (elided) stick dim needs the same two adjustments, but its size and
    its coordinate are set by different passes:

    - Size, here: ``_pad_elided_dim`` prepends an outermost size-64 gap dim.
    - Coordinate, later: ``_restickify_restore_elided_dim`` (spyre_kernel.py)
      mints a fresh iteration symbol just before ``align_tensors``.  It waits
      because both operands must share that symbol for align to match them, and
      align only sees a symbol that already exists when it runs.

    The restore asserts the prepended gap dim is present before binding the
    symbol, so swapping the pass order fails loudly rather than silently.
