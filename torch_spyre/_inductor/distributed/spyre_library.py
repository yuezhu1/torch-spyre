# This provides:
# 1. Proper schema registration
# 2. Automatic fake kernel registration
# 3. Better integration with torch.compile
# 4. C++ implementation via TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL in spyre_distributed.cpp
# This file only registers the abstract (fake/meta) kernels needed by torch.compile
# for shape inference during tracing.

# The spyre::* distributed operators are only compiled into the C++ extension
# when torch-spyre is built with USE_SPYRE_CCL=1 (see setup.py: spyre_distributed.cpp
# is added to the sources only when use_spyre_ccl is true). Registering a fake
# kernel for an operator that was not compiled in raises "operator spyre::... does
# not exist", which would break `import torch` on any USE_SPYRE_CCL=0 build. Only
# register the fakes when the real operators are actually present.
