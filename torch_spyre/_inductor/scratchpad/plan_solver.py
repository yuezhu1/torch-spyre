    Defines the data fields required for a plan solver.

    ``uses`` is the strictly increasing list of operation indices at which the
    buffer is accessed (as returned by ``calculate_liveness``).  It is normally
    non-empty, and callers that read ``start_time``/``end_time`` require that,
    since those properties index into it; the FirstFit/BestFit scoring divides
    by ``len(uses)`` plus a write bonus, which is non-zero for a computed buffer
    even when ``uses`` is empty.  Emptiness is nevertheless allowed at
    construction -- see :meth:`__post_init__` for the registration state that
    needs it.  ``first_use_is_read`` is True for graph inputs (all accesses are
    reads) and False for computed buffers (first access is a write, all
    subsequent accesses are reads).

    Both properties of ``uses`` are asserted in ``__post_init__``.  Strictness
    is what makes ``read_count`` trustworthy: one entry per accessing op means
    that for a computed buffer ``read_count == 0`` is exactly "written, never
    read", which the in-place invariants rely on (see
    :func:`check_in_place_parent_is_read`).  A repeated index would describe a
    buffer written and read by the same op, i.e. with a single live tick, and
    would let such a buffer pass as an in-place parent.

    ``start_time`` and ``end_time`` are convenience properties derived from
    ``uses``: ``uses[0]`` and ``uses[-1] + 1`` respectively.
