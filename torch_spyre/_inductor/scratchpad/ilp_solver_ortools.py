"""Joint core-division + LX-placement solver built on OR-Tools CP-SAT
(``config.layout_solver == "cpsat"``).

Selects each buffer's core division and its LX scratchpad placement in one
constraint model over :class:`CoreDivisionBuffer`s:

* **Joint core-division.** ``size`` is the *total* device footprint; a ``div``
  var indexes the buffer's candidate divisions (from
  ``enumerate_work_division_candidates``) and ``AddElement`` ties the chosen
  index to the per-core footprint (``eff_size = size / output_partition``) and
  total core usage (``cores = cores_used``, including any reduction-axis split).
* **Slicing-match residency gate.** A resident buffer's division must induce the
  same per-core slicing as *every* consumer's, using the precomputed
  ``cd_parent_matches`` pairs over the ``parents`` (producer/consumer) edges; a
  buffer with no consumer, or a consumer with no compatible pair, can never
  reside (``_CoreDivisionBufferWithCpVars.constrain_residency``).
* **Placement** is a global ``AddNoOverlap2D`` over optional rectangles
  (``[start_time, end_time) x [offset, offset + eff_size)``, present iff
  resident). In-place reuse (``in_place_parents`` -> per-edge ``merge_vars``) is
  encoded by *shortening the child's lifetime* by the single handoff tick when
  the merge fires, so the parent and its in-place child abut in time and may
  legally share an offset; the single-tick-overlap invariant
  (``_check_in_place_relationships``) makes this exact. The parent keeps its
  full lifetime, so the footprint above a smaller child stays protected on the
  handoff tick (``_add_no_overlap_2d``).
* **Objective** (two-phase lexicographic, in ``_run``). *Residency is the hard
  priority.* Phase 1 minimizes total **HBM transfer traffic** via
  ``spill_cost(b) * (1 - in_buffer)`` -- the *differential* traffic a spill adds
  over residency (resident buffers contribute 0). An intermediate costs
  ``(num_consumers + 1) * size`` (the producer's HBM write, which residency turns
  into a free LX write, plus one re-read per consumer); a graph input drops the
  producer write it never had and the clone-in read residency cannot avoid
  (``(num_consumers - 1) * size``); a graph output drops its unavoidable
  write-out (``num_consumers * size``). Phase 1 puts as much in LX as possible
  and chooses whatever division serves that (even no split, if that is what lets
  a buffer match its consumers and reside). Phase 2 then *holds that residency
  optimum* and maximizes total core usage (``sum_b cores_b``) so every buffer --
  resident or spilled, the latter free of the slicing gate -- takes its most
  parallel division, which the allocator commits. Parallelism never costs a
  spill.

After the solve, ``_justify`` slides each in-place-merged placement unit down to
the lowest free address, squeezing out float gaps the search leaves. It coarsens
a merged unit to one rectangle over the union of its members' lifetimes, which is
conservative enough that the squeeze can occasionally need more room than the
solver's own answer; when it would not fit, the solver's offsets are kept.

The same model also serves plain :class:`LifetimeBoundBuffer`s via
``plan_layout`` (the ``MemoryPlanSolver`` contract the placement-only allocator
calls). Those buffers carry no candidate divisions, so the division-dependent
pieces -- per-core sizing, the slicing-match gate, the merge division gate and
the phase-2 parallelism objective -- simply drop out: the footprint is the
buffer's ``size`` and the solve reduces to minimising HBM traffic under the 2D
no-overlap with in-place reuse. Residency is then gated only by capacity and by
the allocator's own ``residency_reason`` bars (which both paths honour, since
that field lives on the base buffer). That specialisation
lives on the buffer wrappers (``_LifetimeBufferWithCpVars`` and its joint
subclass ``_CoreDivisionBufferWithCpVars``), so the solver methods below are
written once against whichever wrapper ``_wrap`` chose.

        intersect (touching edges are allowed). Residency is the interval
        presence (``in_buffer``), so spilled buffers drop out for free.

        In-place reuse is handled *inside* this constraint rather than by
        relaxing it: an active incoming merge shortens the child's time interval
        by the single handoff tick it shares with the parent
        (``start -> start + 1``). The parent and child then abut in time at the
        same offset (pinned equal by the merge), which the 2D constraint accepts
        as non-overlapping -- so the child legally reuses the parent's slot. With
        no active merge the child keeps its full lifetime and the shared-offset
        placement is correctly forbidden, exactly as the pairwise encoding did.

        It is the *child* that gives up the tick, never the parent: the parent's
        rectangle has to keep covering the handoff tick at full footprint. The
        child may be smaller than its parent (the placement-only model only
        requires ``child.size <= parent.size``), and the bytes above the child
        are still holding parent data that is read on that tick, so they are not
        free for a third buffer. Shortening the parent instead would expose them
        -- and a parent whose whole lifetime is that one tick would drop out of
        the propagator entirely, exposing its full slot.

        ``AddAtMostOne`` on the incoming edges bounds the shortening at one tick.
        A child whose entire lifetime is the handoff tick degenerates to a
        zero-width box the 2D propagator ignores, which is safe here: the tick is
