    Buffers are sorted topologically (parents before children) with ties broken by ascending
    ``(end_time - start_time - discount) / (len(uses) + write_bonus)``. ``discount`` is 0.25 for
    each in-place relationship the buffer participates in (as a child, as a parent, or both,
    capped at 0.5); ``write_bonus`` is 0.5 when the buffer's first use is a write (i.e.
    ``not first_use_is_read``) and 0 otherwise, since pinning such a buffer also saves the more
    expensive first write to HBM. Lower score = higher priority = placed first.  For each buffer,
    free address gaps during its lifetime are computed; the buffer is placed at the start of the
    first gap large enough to hold it (rounded up to alignment). In-place reuse is attempted
    first: if a declared parent has already been placed and its address falls within a free gap,
    the child inherits that address.  Buffers that cannot fit within self.limit are evicted
