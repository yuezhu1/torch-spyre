        allocated addresses with 0 -> `limit` where the maximum starting address of
        buffers are at most `self.limit` - `LifetimeBoundBuffer.size` - 1. The algorithm
        increments through logical time where time increments 1 unit for each
        step in a computation graph. At each step the lifetimes of all buffers are
        evaluated for allocation and deallocation based on its lifetime relative
        to the time being evaluated. As an optimization, times where no buffers
        enter or exit scope are not evaluated.

        When a buffer enters scope, the current usage is evaluated in the following
        manner:
            1. Check if there is a permissible in-place buffer already allocated
            2. Is there enough space from address 0 -> first usage.
            3. Is there enough space for the current buffer from the max address
                to the maximum memory address. Allocate as current_max + 1 + alignment.
            4. Is there space between allocations. Check for gaps between current
                allocations and find where gaps exceed current size. Allocate if
                current gap is larger than current size + alignment.
