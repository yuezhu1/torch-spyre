"""Permutation-based incremental layout solving.

A permutation fixes an allocation order; :class:`PermutationBasedLayoutSolver`
places buffers in that order and maintains addresses incrementally under
``swap``/``rotate`` via the order-based contact profiles, while
:class:`ReferencePermutationBasedLayoutSolver` is a from-scratch oracle used
for differential testing. The :class:`Profile` step function is the contact
data structure both build on. Search policies (e.g. the simulated-annealing search)
drive this substrate by composition; it knows nothing about how the
permutation is chosen.

class PermutationBasedLayoutSolverBase(ABC):
    """Shared state and interface for capacity-bounded allocation plans.

    A plan places a set of :class:`LifetimeBoundBuffer` objects into a
    fixed-capacity scratchpad following a *permutation*: an explicit allocation
    order given as a list of buffer indices. Buffer ``permutation[k]`` is
    allocated on top of every already-placed buffer whose lifetime overlaps it
    (respecting in-place parents), rounded up to ``alignment``.

    Addresses are maintained internally and are **not** written back to the
    buffer objects until :meth:`finalize`. Two buffers that are alive at the
    same logical tick may not occupy overlapping address ranges, with the sole
    exception of an in-place parent/child pair, which may share an identical
    address (``P.end_time == C.start_time + 1``).

    The objective being optimized is :meth:`quality`: the summed
    :func:`buffer_quality` (use-weighted size) of every buffer that fits
    *entirely* below ``capacity``. A buffer whose placement would cross the
    capacity line is *evicted* -- its address is ``None`` (the single source of
    truth for eviction) and it is neither counted nor written back on
    :meth:`finalize`. Eviction is upward-closed: anything that would rest on an
    evicted buffer is evicted too.

    Subclasses implement :meth:`_build` (initial placement) and :meth:`swap`
    (incremental re-placement after exchanging two adjacent permutation
    entries).

    Args:
        buffers: The buffers to place. Indices into this list are the values
            used in ``permutation`` and as keys throughout the plan.
        permutation: Allocation order as a permutation of
            ``range(len(buffers))``.
        capacity: Scratchpad capacity in bytes.
        alignment: Byte alignment boundary for placed addresses. Defaults to 128
            (one Spyre stick).
        eligible: Optional per-buffer LX-eligibility flags (indexed like
            ``buffers``). ``None`` means every buffer is eligible -- the layout-
            only default, byte-for-byte identical to the pre-eligibility solver.
            An ineligible buffer keeps its permutation slot but is routed to HBM:
            it is transparent to the stack (contributes no address, no quality,
            and nothing rests on it). Toggle it live with :meth:`set_eligible`.

        A no-op when the swapped buffers do not overlap in time. Otherwise:

        1. Over their shared column range the two buffers' per-column order
           transposes and nothing else changes, so the contact profiles are
           updated by a handful of splices (:meth:`_update_profiles_for_swap`).
        2. Addresses are then re-placed for the buffers the change reaches,
           processed in a min-heap by position (dependencies always point to
           earlier positions, so a buffer is settled before anything resting on
           it; ``position`` is maintained in O(1)). Two kinds of edge feed the
           dirty set:

           - *Order-above.* When ``z``'s address changes, the buffers directly
             above it -- ``above_profile[z]`` -- are dirtied. This is the cheap
             contact-profile frontier and it is exactly right whenever the
             buffer a dependent rests on is also its order-below neighbour.

           - *In-place transition.* In-placement makes the contact order and the
             rest-on order diverge: a transparent in-place child sits low while
             its taller parent pokes through and binds the buffer above the
             child. While that in-placement is stable the order-above frontier
             still suffices (the child's address tracks the parent it reuses, so
             a change in the parent reaches the buffer above the child through
             the child). The gap is at the *transition*: when a buffer ``z``'s
             in-place status flips (activates or deactivates), the poke-through
             appears or vanishes, so the buffer resting on it must be revisited
             even though nothing it can see changed value. So on a status change
             we dirty the order-above neighbour of *both* members of the pair at
             their shared (overlap) tick -- the parent's above-neighbour is the
             child, and the child's above-neighbour is the buffer that gains or
             loses the poke-through.

    ``config.native_layout_packer`` is true (the default -- back it off with that
    config knob, or its ``TORCH_SPYRE_NATIVE_PACKER=0`` env default), and the
    canonical Python :class:`PermutationBasedLayoutSolver` when it is false. The
    two are behaviourally identical (verified bit-for-bit by the differential and
    the SA-equivalence tests); the C++ one is the faster default.
