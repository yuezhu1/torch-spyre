def insert_post_mutation_restickify(graph: GraphLowering) -> None:
    """
    Insert pre/post ops around a slice mutation when the original layout cannot
    express the required stick offset.

    In that case, propagate_layouts picks an alternate layout and stores
    op._restickify_plan = (target_name, orig_stl, alt_stl). Because the
    restickify op cannot write its output in place, the mutation writes into a
    temporary buffer buf_tmp in alt_stl layout. This pass inserts:

      1. restickify op: arg0_1 (orig_stl) -> buf_tmp        (alt_stl)
      2. mutation op:   buf               -> buf_tmp[slice] (alt_stl)
      3. copy-back op:  buf_tmp (alt_stl) -> arg0_1         (alt_stl)
      4. set_spyre_tensor_layout(arg0_1, alt_stl)

    Both (1) and (3) are inserted as restickify IR nodes via
    _create_restickify_node. In (3), the input and output STLs are both alt_stl,
    so in the later codegen pass it reduces to an identity copy. Its layout is set
    to MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE(arg0_1), which makes the scheduler write the
    result back to arg0_1's original memory address.

    Both the mutation op and the copy-back use MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE to
    declare their write targets and reuse Inductor's existing mutation handling.

    The restickify op also records an input-layout override on
    buf_tmp._input_layout_overrides so work division and codegen both read
    arg0_1 using orig_stl for that op.

    arg0_1 is returned unchanged so DCI still reads from the same memory address.
