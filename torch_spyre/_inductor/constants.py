    Compatible when either:
      1. Every operand shares a single EA (any EA, including all-STANDARD), or
      2. The broadcast pattern: exactly one distinct *non-STANDARD* EA is present
         (on one or more operands) and every remaining operand is STANDARD. The
         STANDARD operands broadcast against the non-STANDARD ("staggered")
         element ordering, so a single such ordering is fine but two different
         ones are not.

    EXX2 is excluded from the broadcast pattern: it is a reduction mode (two
    values per stick), not a broadcastable ordering. It is only valid when *all*
    operands share it (case 1); layernorm ops carrying EXX2 are handled by a
    separate skip in ``validate_ops``.

    This predicate governs EA-*set* membership only. The additional device-layout
    constraint that STANDARD operands in the mixed case must broadcast at the
    stick dim (stick size 1) is enforced separately in
    ``_multi_arg_pointwise_layouts`` where the concrete layouts are available.
