    Passes running between collect and recover can both insert nodes (e.g.

    nodes (e.g. auto_functionalized_v2 is replaced). The algorithm must handle
    both cases:

    - Inserted nodes (in graph, not in snapshot): skip the node, leave it
      with whatever meta["custom"] it already has.
    - Deleted nodes (in snapshot, not in graph): skip past the snapshot entry
      to stay aligned with the graph.

    the snapshot (from the current cursor) looking for a matching target. If
    found, consume all snapshot entries up to and including it. If not found,
    the node was inserted after the snapshot — leave it untouched. A node
