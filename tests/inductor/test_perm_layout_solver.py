        the same ``_placement_decision`` as the full earlier-overlapping set.

        Placement reads neither capacity nor alignment, so the equivalence is
        independent of both and one of each suffices. ~82k configs, 33k of them
        carrying an in-place edge, in a few seconds. The heavier validation
        (n up to 4, larger sizes, live swap propagation) lives in StressTests
        and the one-off exhaustive sweep.

        ``horizon`` is 4 rather than 3 because requiring the parent to be read
        costs every in-place pair a tick: the parent must be written and then
        read before it hands over, so the earliest legal handoff is tick 1 and
        the earliest a child can start is 1, where it used to be 0.  (A child
        starting at 0 has no legal parent at any horizon -- that one is inherent
        to the rule, not a horizon effect.)  At horizon 3 there is no longer room
        for the shifted pairs and the wirings carrying an in-place edge collapse
        from 29k to 8k; horizon 4 gives them the tick back, at 33k.

    ``plan.permutation`` returns a ``PermutationView`` that *borrows* its solver
    and reads straight through to the solver's ``std::vector``. Two opposite
    things must hold, and the rest of the suite establishes neither:

    - It must stay **valid**. Nothing else in these tests lets a view outlive its
      solver, so a view left reading freed memory would go unnoticed -- and did:
      the ``py::keep_alive`` securing this was initially attached to the property
      rather than to the getter, where it silently does nothing, and the whole
      suite passed regardless.
    - It must stay **live**. ``annealing_step_swap`` captures the view once and
      re-reads it after each ``swap``, so a snapshot would make the search read
      pre-swap values. That degrades rather than breaks: the search would simply
      explore a different trajectory and still return a feasible layout, so only
      the cross-packer equivalence test could notice, and only because it demands
      bit-identical trajectories.

    These are failures where the program keeps running and produces plausible
    output, which is why they are asserted against the mechanism directly.
