    This is the placement-only contract: the core division is already fixed
    upstream, so the footprint is just ``size`` and the division-dependent parts
    of the model drop out. Unlike the joint path there is no *slicing* gate --
    a buffer needs no consumer edge to reside -- so the base suite's buffers
    need no synthetic sink; the allocator's ``residency_reason`` bars still
    apply on both paths. ``make_buffer`` is inherited from
    :class:`BaseLayoutSolverTests`, so every shared test below runs against
    plain buffers; only ``check_result`` is relaxed, because CP-SAT returns a
    valid packing rather than the gap heuristics' exact addresses.
