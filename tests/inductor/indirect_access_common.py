"""Shared test utilities for indirect-access (gather/scatter) tests.

This file isn't named test_* so pytest won't run it directly. The test files
import helpers from here, organized one file per op family:

  * test_indirect_access_gather.py    -- gather ops (x[i], index_select, torch.gather)
  * test_indirect_access_scatter.py   -- scatter ops (out[i]=src, scatter_, index_copy)
  * test_indirect_access_internals.py -- device-free unit tests for the harness/helpers

How it works: each scenario compiles once and is checked across every stage --
detection, OpSpec structure, SDSC fields -- in one place, via run_scenario
and IndirectAccessTestCase.check (slice by stage with the op=, detected=,
sdsc= parameters). The capture machinery intercepts the compiler before
SuperDSC, records the generated OpSpecs, and returns a no-op runner -- so we
test compiler output without actual hardware or numeric results.

For a gather/scatter outcome, check does not stop at "the SDSC json exists":
IndirectAccessTestCase.assert_indirect_sdsc_fields validates the full
indirect-access encoding the backend depends on -- index/value allocation
types, HBM-only index tensors, the index<->value cross-links, and the
computeOp routing. bundle_jsons_from_captured lets a test that only captured
op specs move on to that same SDSC validation without recompiling.

run_e2e drives the real backend (no mocking), mirroring the standalone
gather.py script: it compiles and runs on device, then reports an *expected
failure* (pytest.xfail) when the values diverge from the CPU reference or the
backend aborts -- because the backend does not yet implement indirect access
correctly. The xfail is raised after the capture-path stage checks run, so those
stay strict; when the backend is fixed and results match, no xfail is raised and
the test passes (xpass alerts you if a hard-coded expectation goes stale). For
expect_close=True ops a mismatch/failure is instead a hard error. Only gather
reaches this path today; the name is generic so scatter can reuse it later.

    backend and validate the device result against the CPU reference.

    Unlike the capture-based helpers, this mocks nothing: it drives the full
    `bundle -> dxp_standalone -> launch_jobplan` path, exactly like the
    standalone `tests/indirect_access/gather.py` script.  `dev_args` are the
    device tensors the kernel is invoked with; the CPU reference is computed
    from their host copies.

    Today only gather kernels reach the indirect path -- the name is
    deliberately generic so scatter (and other indirect ops) can reuse it once
    the backend supports them.

    The CPU reference is computed first; if *that* raises it is a problem with
    the test itself (e.g. an out-of-bounds index) and is allowed to propagate.

    The device compile/run is best-effort: the backend does not yet support
    every indirect-access pattern and aborts (SIGABRT in dxp_standalone) on some
    of them. A backend failure -- and likewise a value divergence -- is reported
    as an *expected failure* (pytest.xfail) rather than warned or hard-failed, so
    "always run e2e" surfaces known backend gaps as xfail (and flips to xpass the
    day the backend is fixed) without turning the suite red. Because xfail is
    raised imperatively *after* the capture-path stage checks have run, those
    checks stay strict. (For `expect_close=True` ops, which must work, a failure
    or divergence is a hard assertion/raise instead.)

    Result validation:
      * the output is checked for the correct shape and dtype;
      * the values are compared against the golden CPU reference and the
        max-abs-diff recorded;
      * `expect_close` controls the value assertion:
          - `True`  -> assert the result matches (use for ops that must be
                         correct, e.g. a supported direct op or CPU fallback);
          - `False` -> assert the result diverges (pin a known-bad path);
          - `None`  -> xfail on divergence (the default for on-device indirect
                         gather, which the backend does not yet implement
                         correctly). When it is fixed and results match, no xfail
                         is raised and the test simply passes.

    Returns an `E2EResult` when the result matched (or expect_close handled it);
    on divergence/backend failure it raises pytest.xfail and does not return.

        value-table / destination data dim (c1). The entry dim is the index
        tensor's stick dim, so it splits in whole 32-entry sticks: the split is
        the planner's ``core_split`` -- the largest divisor of the stick count
        ``ceil(index_size / 32)`` that does not exceed SENCORES (so it always
        divides evenly, and a non-power-of-two core count like 6 rounds down to
        the nearest divisor, e.g. 8 sticks over 6 cores -> 4). The ceiling
        handles a NON-stick-aligned count, whose partial last stick is padded up
        to a whole stick (enforce_indirect_access_layout) so the dim still
