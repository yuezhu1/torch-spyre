# Runtime

The Torch-Spyre runtime layer manages device lifecycle, memory
allocation, and kernel execution at inference time. This section
covers the device-registration plumbing, the C++ tensor and allocator
machinery, eager-mode dispatch, streams, and multi-card support.

## Responsibilities

- **Device registration** — registering `spyre` as a PyTorch device type
- **Tensor memory management** — allocating and freeing device DRAM (DDR)
  for `SpyreTensorImpl` objects
- **DMA transfers** — moving tensor data between host (CPU) memory and
  device (DDR) memory via the `to()` / `from_device()` APIs
- **Kernel dispatch** — loading compiled program binaries and
  orchestrating their execution across Spyre cores

:width: 45%
:align: center

The PyTorch Dispatcher routes each operation to the correct device implementation. When a `torch.add` call carries Spyre tensors, the Dispatcher looks up `SPYRE` in its dispatch table and calls the registered `spyre__add_Tensor` kernel. Torch-Spyre registers all its eager runtime kernels in this table via `TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL`.
:::

## Device Registration

Torch-Spyre registers `spyre` as a PyTorch device using the
`PrivateUse1` mechanism — the standard PyTorch pathway for out-of-tree
accelerators. Registration happens in `torch_spyre/__init__.py`'s
`_autoload()`:

```python
torch.utils.rename_privateuse1_backend("spyre")
torch._register_device_module("spyre", make_spyre_module())
```

This gives the device a human-readable name (`"spyre"`) without
requiring any upstream PyTorch changes. A custom
`SpyreGuardImpl` implements `c10::impl::DeviceGuardImplInterface`
to handle device management and synchronization.

### Device Enumeration

`torch.spyre.device_count()` is handled by the PrivateUse1 hooks registered in `csrc/module.cpp`, which look up the visible-device set from a small group of environment variables read in `csrc/spyre_device_enum.cpp`:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `AIU_WORLD_SIZE` | Overrides the visible device count. |
| `SPYRE_DEVICES` | Comma-separated list of device indices to expose. |
| `FLEX_DEVICE` | Selects the underlying flex runtime mode (`PF`, `VF`, or `MOCK`). |

The count itself comes from `flex::getNumDevices`.

## Key C++ Components

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `csrc/module.cpp` | pybind11 entry point for the `_C` extension module. Device registration itself happens in `torch_spyre/__init__.py::_autoload()`. |
| `csrc/spyre_tensor_impl.cpp` | `SpyreTensorImpl`, the device tensor backing store. |
| `csrc/spyre_mem.cpp` | Device tensor factory ops (`spyre_empty*`, `resize_`) and host↔device copy: builds the `DataConversionInfo` (DCI) descriptors via `generate_dci` that drive `copyAsync` transfers between host memory and LPDDR5. |
| `csrc/spyre_allocator.cpp` | `SpyreAllocator`, which bridges PyTorch's `c10::Allocator` to `flex::FlexAllocator`. |
| `csrc/spyre_storage_impl.cpp` | `SpyreStorageImpl`, the storage object backing `SpyreTensorImpl`. |
| `csrc/spyre_views.cpp` | Tensor view and striding support on device, including `_reshape_alias`. |
| `csrc/spyre_guard.cpp` | `SpyreGuardImpl`, device guard and synchronization. |
| `csrc/spyre_stream.cpp` | Stream management for asynchronous execution. |
| `csrc/spyre_device_enum.cpp` | Visible-device enumeration. Reads `AIU_WORLD_SIZE`, `SPYRE_DEVICES`, `FLEX_DEVICE`. |
| `csrc/logging.cpp` | C++ debug logging, gated on `TORCH_SPYRE_DEBUG`. |
| `csrc/profiler/` | PyTorch Profiler (PrivateUse1) integration. |
| `csrc/attn_utils.cpp` | SDPA dispatch. Routes `scaled_dot_product_attention` to the Spyre backend, with GQA support. |

## Python Entry Point

`torch_spyre/__init__.py` is loaded automatically by PyTorch via the
`torch.backends` entry point declared in `pyproject.toml`. This triggers
device and backend registration without requiring an explicit import.

The Spyre device allocator call chain. A `torch.empty(..., device="spyre")` call flows through `spyre_empty_strided` into `SpyreAllocator::allocate`, which calls `flex_alloc->allocate(nbytes, directive)` ([`spyre_allocator.cpp:167`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/csrc/spyre_allocator.cpp#L167)).
:::

## Memory Model

Spyre tensors live in off-chip LPDDR5. Before any kernel runs, the compiler stages the tiles it needs into a much smaller on-core LX scratchpad and the kernel reads from there. The runtime, though, only deals with the LPDDR5 side. Everything below is about how a Spyre tensor in Python turns into a real LPDDR5 allocation, and how that allocation eventually finds its way back to the pool.

:::{figure} ../_static/images/spyre-memory-hierarchy.svg
:alt: Spyre memory hierarchy showing host CPU, LPDDR5 device memory, and LX scratchpad
:width: 75%
:align: center

The two levels of memory the device sees. Full tensors stay in LPDDR5. The compiler emits load/store instructions that stage active tiles into the per-core LX scratchpad just in time for each kernel. The runtime owns the LPDDR5 allocation that backs every Spyre tensor.
:::

For the layout that lets the runtime actually walk one of those tensors, see [Tensors and Layouts](../user_guide/tensors_and_layouts.md). The next two sections cover what the C++ side of that looks like and how the lifetime ends.

### SpyreTensorImpl

A standard PyTorch `(size, stride)` pair cannot describe a tiled device tensor, so Torch-Spyre defines `SpyreTensorImpl` as a subclass of `TensorImpl`. The subclass adds three members: a `SpyreTensorLayout` (`spyre_layout`) plus two standalone vectors, `dma_sizes` and `dma_strides`. Together they capture everything the runtime needs.

The `SpyreTensorLayout` holds:

- `device_size` — the tensor's shape on device, including the extra tiling and padding dims.
- `stride_map` — the host stride for each device dim. A `-1` here means the dim is synthetic or fully padded.
- `device_dtype` — the on-device data format, for example `SEN169_FP16`.
- `element_arrangement` — how elements are packed within a stick (defaults to `STANDARD`).

Alongside the layout, `SpyreTensorImpl` carries `dma_sizes` and `dma_strides` directly — a host-shape DMA descriptor used when copying views back to the host. They drive `copyAsync()` in `spyre_stream.cpp`.

Note that the handles returned to Python never carry a raw device pointer. That is a hard requirement on IBM Z.

:::{figure} ../_static/images/spyre-tensor-impl-anatomy.png
:alt: Nested boxes showing at::Tensor wrapping TensorImpl wrapping SpyreTensorImpl wrapping SpyreTensorLayout
:width: 80%
:align: center

What is behind a Spyre tensor, drawn as a stack of layers. Python only ever sees the outermost `at::Tensor` handle. Underneath, `c10::TensorImpl` carries the standard tensor metadata, and the Spyre subclass adds a `SpyreTensorLayout` (device shape, `stride_map`, device dtype, and `element_arrangement`) plus the standalone `dma_sizes`/`dma_strides` DMA descriptor.
:::

### SpyreAllocator

`SpyreAllocator` (`csrc/spyre_allocator.cpp`) is a thin bridge between PyTorch's `c10::Allocator` and `flex::FlexAllocator`. Every `allocate(nbytes)` call passes straight through to `flex_alloc->allocate(nbytes)` and returns a `c10::DataPtr` with a `ReportAndDelete` callback installed as its deleter. When the tensor's storage refcount hits zero, that deleter runs, updates the `DeviceStats` counters, and hands the allocation back to flex. The trigger is PyTorch's own refcount: Python's garbage collector is not in this loop at all.

What `flex_alloc->allocate(nbytes)` returns is a `flex::CompositeAddress`, a handle that can describe contiguous *or* discontiguous (interleaved) device-memory regions as an ordered list of chunks. `SpyreAllocator` wraps it in a `SharedOwnerCtx` (declared in `csrc/spyre_allocator.h`) so the `ReportAndDelete` deleter can recover the original handle when freeing. The `at::DataPtr` Python sees never carries a raw pointer. Ownership stays on the C++ side through the shared owner.

:::{figure} ../_static/images/spyre-tensor-lifetime.png
:alt: Five-step flowchart showing how a Python tensor going out of scope frees a Spyre allocation
:width: 75%
:align: center

What happens between a Python tensor going out of scope and the device allocation returning to the flex pool. The piece that connects the two ends is the `ReportAndDelete` callback that `SpyreAllocator` installs on every `c10::DataPtr` it hands out.
:::

When the allocator runs out of memory regions it invokes a registered
memory-pressure callback. The torch-spyre callback releases the allocator mutex,
calls `PyGC_Collect()` to free Python cyclic garbage, and re-acquires the mutex
before returning — allowing the allocation to be retried. See
[Memory Pressure and Python GC](memory_pressure_gc.md) for the full GIL
interaction and lock-ordering details.

Physical-frame (PF) and virtual-frame (VF) execution are *not* allocator strategies inside `SpyreAllocator`. The mode is picked by the `FLEX_DEVICE` environment variable, which configures the underlying flex runtime (see `csrc/spyre_device_enum.cpp`):

| Mode | Selection | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| PF (Physical Frame) | `FLEX_DEVICE=PF` | Direct hardware execution path. |
| VF (Virtual Frame) | `FLEX_DEVICE=VF` | Virtualized hardware, used in multi-tenant deployments. |
| MOCK | `FLEX_DEVICE=MOCK` | Software simulation with no hardware; device count comes from `AIU_WORLD_SIZE`. |

## Eager Operations

Eager kernels reach the Spyre dispatch key from two Python sources.

The first is manual registrations in [`torch_spyre/ops/eager.py`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/ops/eager.py), which use `register_torch_compile_kernel` to register the 45+ ops in `COMPILED_OPS` (arithmetic, comparison, reduction, activation, and view ops) for the PrivateUse1 dispatch key.

In-place variants are *derived* from that same list by `register_inplace_kernels`, not listed separately: each `foo_` overload whose signature matches its functional `foo` sibling gets a kernel that computes functionally and writes back with `self.copy_()`. In-place ops must never be added to `COMPILED_OPS` directly — a standalone-compiled in-place kernel bakes its write-destination address at trace time and can clobber an unrelated live buffer, whereas `copy_` is addressed at runtime.

The match requires the same overload name *and* an identical argument signature modulo the `(a!)` write-alias, so a same-named pair with different operand order is rejected rather than mis-paired: `pow_.Scalar(Tensor self, Scalar exponent)` versus `pow.Scalar(Scalar self, Tensor exponent)` would otherwise yield a kernel computing `other ** self`. The kernel also enforces PyTorch's in-place dtype contract, raising if the promoted result cannot be cast back to `self`.

The second is CPU fallbacks in [`torch_spyre/ops/fallbacks.py`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/ops/fallbacks.py), registered through `@register_fallback` (or the `register_fallback_default` helper for plain pass-throughs). These cover the long tail: `arange`, `embedding`, `cumsum`, `tril`/`triu`, `isin`, `bitwise_xor`/`bitwise_or`, `argmax`, and similar.

Inductor decompositions registered through `register_spyre_decomposition` also dispatch eagerly when the underlying ATen op does not already have a PrivateUse1 kernel. See the [supported operations table](../user_guide/supported_operations.md) for the full list.

C++ kernels can still be registered through the usual `TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL` block, but most of the public eager surface today comes from the Python sources above.

## Streams

Torch-Spyre supports stream-based asynchronous execution, following the
same API pattern as `torch.cuda` streams:

| API | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `torch.spyre.Stream()` | Create a new Spyre stream |
| `torch.spyre.stream(s)` | Pass-through helper used inside `with` blocks; the current-stream swap is performed by `Stream.__enter__/__exit__` |
| `torch.spyre.current_stream()` | Get the current stream for the device |
| `torch.spyre.default_stream()` | Get the default stream for the device |
| `torch.spyre.synchronize()` | Wait for all operations on all streams to complete |

Streams are implemented in `torch_spyre/streams.py` (Python) and
`csrc/spyre_stream.cpp` (C++).

### Stream Pool

Each device keeps a fixed pool of streams (see `csrc/spyre_stream.cpp`). Stream `0` is the default. Streams `1` through `32` form the low-priority pool (`priority == 0`); streams `33` through `64` form the high-priority pool (any non-zero priority). Each pool holds 32 streams per device and allocates round-robin. Stream IDs `65` and above are reserved for the host-compute pool that program correction runs on; its size is set by `TORCH_SPYRE_NUM_HOST_COMPUTE_STREAMS` (default 4, maximum 8).

On input, `priority` is a binary switch: `0` selects the low-priority pool and any non-zero value selects the high-priority pool. The `Stream.priority` getter does not echo the constructor value back. It reports `0` for low-priority streams and `-1` for high-priority streams, matching `torch.cuda.Stream.priority`. The asymmetry is implemented in `csrc/spyre_stream.cpp` `SpyreStream::priority`.

## SpyreCode and JobPlan

A compiled artifact reaches the runtime as a **SpyreCode** directory: a JSON-based
manifest plus binary blobs produced by the deeptools backend. `prepareKernel`
in `csrc/prepare_kernel.{h,cpp}` translates that directory into a `JobPlan`,
the runtime's executable container for a single launch.

:::{figure} ../_static/images/runtime/spyrecode-flow.svg
:alt: SpyreCode directory flowing through prepareKernel into a JobPlan, then queued on a stream by SpyreStream::launch
:width: 90%
:align: center

The SpyreCode directory is the compile-time handoff. `prepareKernel` translates it into a `JobPlan` of ordered `JobPlanStep` instances, and `SpyreStream::launch` queues the corresponding `RuntimeOperation`s on the stream in FIFO order.
:::

### JobPlan structure

A `JobPlan` (declared in `csrc/job_plan.h`) holds an ordered list of
`JobPlanStep` instances. At launch time, each step constructs a
`flex::RuntimeOperation` via its `construct(LaunchContext&)` method and the
runtime queues those operations on the stream in order. The four step types
cover every operation a launch needs:

| Step type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `JobPlanStepH2D` | Host-to-device DMA transfer |
| `JobPlanStepD2H` | Device-to-host DMA transfer |
| `JobPlanStepCompute` | Kernel execution on the device |
| `JobPlanStepHostCompute` | Host-side computation (used for program correction) |

`SpyreStream::launch(plan, args)` walks the steps, builds the
`RuntimeOperation` for each one, and submits them to the underlying
`flex::RuntimeStream`. FIFO ordering on the stream is what makes the step
sequence safe: each step completes before the next one starts.

### Program correction

Compiled binaries arrive with symbolic placeholders for tensor addresses that
are only known at launch (allocator output, padding, batch shape). The runtime
patches them in three ordered steps:

:::{figure} ../_static/images/runtime/program-correction.svg
:alt: HostCompute step writes a correction buffer, H2D copies it to the device, Compute runs the patched kernel
:width: 90%
:align: center

Three ordered `RuntimeOperation`s on a stream: a CPU callback computes the corrections into a pinned host buffer, an H2D step DMAs the buffer into the program region, and the kernel runs after reading the corrections. The same pinned buffer cycles across iterations.
:::

1. **`JobPlanStepHostCompute`** runs on the host. It calls into deeptools'
   `processComputeOnHostCommand` with compiler-supplied metadata (`Hcm`) and
   writes a small correction blob into a pinned host buffer. The closure
   captures the metadata, the destination CompositeAddresses, and the buffer
   pointer.
2. **`JobPlanStepH2D`** copies that buffer into the program region on the device.
3. **`JobPlanStepCompute`** then runs the kernel. The device-side prologue
   reads the corrections, patches the symbolic operands, and starts execution.

The pinned host buffer is allocated once during `prepareKernel` and reused
across launches. For tiled execution the same buffer cycles through every
iteration — FIFO ordering guarantees each iteration's H2D consumes the buffer
before the next iteration's HostCompute overwrites it.

## Multi-card and distributed execution

Ensembles of up to 8 Spyre cards deliver up to 1 TB of aggregate device memory.
Cross-card collective communication is exposed through the standard PyTorch
`ProcessGroup` API.

### The `spyreccl` backend

Torch-Spyre registers a `c10d::Backend` named `spyreccl`. The class is
`SpyreCCLBackend` in `csrc/distributed/spyre_ccl.{cpp,hpp}`, registered with the
process-group machinery via `createSpyreCCLBackend`, wired up in
`_create_spyre_ccl_backend` in `torch_spyre/__init__.py` when the user invokes
`init_process_group(backend="spyreccl")`. The constant
`DISTRIBUTED_BACKEND_NAME = "spyreccl"` is defined in `torch_spyre/constants.py`.

Standard usage looks like any other PyTorch distributed setup:

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist

dist.init_process_group(backend="cpu:gloo,spyre:spyreccl")

x = torch.zeros(1024, dtype=torch.float16, device="spyre")
dist.broadcast(x, src=0)
```

Internally, `SpyreCCLBackend` forwards each tensor to the closed-source
`spyre_comms` library, which handles the wire-level transport between cards.
The torch-spyre adapter is open. The transport library is not.

The layers between user code and the device. Green boxes are in-tree (Apache-2.0). The transport library is closed source.
:::

### Supported collectives

The following collectives are implemented today, all in synchronous (blocking)
mode:

| Collective | Status |
|---|---|
| `send`, `recv` | Implemented |
| `broadcast` | Implemented |
| `barrier` | Implemented |
| `gather` | Implemented |
| `allgather` | Implemented |
| `reduce` | Implemented |
| `allreduce` | Implemented |

`asyncOp=True` is rejected uniformly across these methods. The remaining
process-group entries (`scatter`, `reduce_scatter`, `alltoall`,
`alltoall_base`, `_allgather_base`, `allreduce_coalesced`) raise
`SpyreCCLNotSupportedException`. `recvAnysource` is intentionally
unsupported — the protocol overhead is high and call sites are rare.

### One device per process

`SpyreCCLBackend` follows the one-device-per-process model. Each rank attaches
to a single Spyre device (typically `torch.device(f"spyre:{os.getenv('RANK', '0')}")`
in the user code). The backend reuses the rank's existing flex runtime instance
and default stream. It does not own a separate runtime context.
